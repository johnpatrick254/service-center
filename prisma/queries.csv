"Hi Branch, am among your best beneficiaries of the Tala platform. However, I have hit a 'dead-end' situation on my payment which is late for almost 5weeks after I took the loan. It has been caused by a temporal stagnation from my employment that was abruptly halted due to funding issues. Need to request for a little time extra as I commit myself to clear this loan I have. Kindly respond we agree on an amicable plan if payment. My Tel: 0723 496 592."

"Hi Branch...now my Application was rejected recently on 1st Feb 2017. I had borrowed Sh.25,000 in December 2015 of which I was slightly late in paying but I payed the whole loan today only to be dissapointed when I apply for another. It says I reapply again in 7days which is too long for me at the moment because I desperately need the cash. How can you assist?"
